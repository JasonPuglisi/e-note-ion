# Content

This directory contains the JSON files that define what gets displayed on the
board. Each file is loaded and watched at runtime — add, edit, or remove a file
and it takes effect within a few seconds without restarting.

See the root [README](../README.md) for the full content file format.

## Files

### `aria.json`

Sample content for Aria, a cat. Schedules breakfast and dinner reminders at
08:00 and 20:00, with an hourly default message, each paired with a random
cat-themed quip.
