## Social preview (`social-preview.png`)

The GitHub repository social preview image was generated using
[Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic). The image was iteratively refined
through several rounds of feedback. The final prompt used to produce it:

```
Generate a social media preview image at 1280×640 pixels for a GitHub
repository called "e-note-ion". The name is a play on both "Vestaboard Note"
(a split-flap display) and the Carly Rae Jepsen album "E•MO•TION".

Style: 80s synthpop / E•MO•TION album aesthetic. Soft pastel gradient
background, pink fading to lavender or light blue. Dreamy, warm, slightly
retro. No photorealism — graphic design / illustration style.

Center element: A split-flap display showing "E-NOTE-ION" across 11 tiles:
E, -, N, O, T, E, -, I, O, N. The dashes should be rendered as proper dark
flap tiles with a - character, not bullet points or spacers. A couple of tiles
(e.g. the O and I) should appear mid-flip to show motion — show a slightly
rotated top-half flap arriving, using CSS rotateX perspective. Tile bodies are
dark (near-black purple-dark), characters in warm cream/white with a subtle
glow. Include a horizontal split line across the middle of each tile.

Title: "E·NOTE·ION" in Bebas Neue bold retro typography, styled like the
E•MO•TION album logo. Use two small filled pink circles (#d94f7a) as the dot
separators between E, NOTE, and ION. Font size ~96px, dark color, slight text
shadow.

Tagline below the title in lighter weight (DM Sans, 300 weight, ~22px):
"Automation for Vestaboard displays — with emotion" — no trailing period,
sentence case (capitalize Automation and Vestaboard only).

Accents: A dozen small colored square tiles (red #e8453c, orange #f28b30,
yellow #f5c842, green #4caf6e) scattered loosely around the composition like
confetti, referencing Vestaboard's colored character codes. Vary sizes
(~13–20px), rotations, and opacity slightly. Keep them within the canvas but
outside the central content area.

Layout: Keep all important content within a 40pt safe border. No GitHub label
or watermark. Clean, centered composition with the display above the title and
tagline stacked below.
